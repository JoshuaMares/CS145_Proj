Some weights of the model checkpoint at microsoft/deberta-base were not used when initializing DebertaForSequenceClassification: ['lm_predictions.lm_head.dense.bias', 'lm_predictions.lm_head.dense.weight', 'lm_predictions.lm_head.LayerNorm.weight', 'lm_predictions.lm_head.bias', 'lm_predictions.lm_head.LayerNorm.bias']
- This IS expected if you are initializing DebertaForSequenceClassification from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing DebertaForSequenceClassification from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Some weights of DebertaForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at microsoft/deberta-base and are newly initialized: ['pooler.dense.bias', 'classifier.bias', 'pooler.dense.weight', 'classifier.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
